### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This readme is under constructionðŸš§

## About me
<p>
I'm an entrepreneur with many years of experience in teamwork, with initiative and flexibility. Iâ€™ve been part of the Scout Movement for more than 10 years, growing in values and useful tools for the promotion of effective communication and management of diverse situations.
<br><br>
My studies and my working experience in many different areas showed me the potential of interdisciplinar synergy, allowing me to maximize knowledge and achieve more integral and comprehensive projects.
<br><br>
ðŸ¤” I'm currently looking for new opportunities that allow me to expand my knowledge and grow professionally.
